## 🧭 Session 1 – Clean Architecture Foundations

**Date:** Thursday  
**Duration:** ~1 hour

### 🎯 Objective

Understand what _software architecture_ really means and why “clean” design is about minimizing human effort, not chasing perfection.

---

### 📚 Reading (30 – 35 min)

From _Clean Architecture_ (Robert C. Martin):

- Preface
- **Chapter 1 – “What Is Design and Architecture?”**
- (Optional) Begin Chapter 2 – “A Tale of Two Values.”

🧠 Focus questions:

- What does Uncle Bob mean by “architecture’s goal is to minimize the human resources required”?
- Why are design and architecture part of the same continuum?
- What is the “signature of a mess”?
- Why is _“The only way to go fast is to go well”_ a rule of economics, not art?

`## Key Insights -`

### 💻 Practical Exercise (15 min)

In Visual Studio → **Projects/Week1/CleanArchitectureIntro**

`Console.WriteLine("The only way to go fast is to go well."); Console.WriteLine("— Clean Architecture, Chapter 1");`

Run (Ctrl + F5) to verify environment.  
Then commit:

`git add . git commit -m "Session 1 – Clean Architecture foundations" git push origin main`

### 🧾 Reflection (10 – 15 min)

Add to `Week1_LearningLog.md`:

|Date|Topic|Hours|Key Takeaway|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Thursday|Clean Architecture Ch. 1|1 hr|Architecture is an economic discipline.|Setup validated + first reading.|

Then finish with:

> “How does this principle show up in the systems I’ve seen at work?”

### 🔮 Next Session Preview

Next session (Saturday): **Dependency Injection Principles, Ch. 1 – “The Basics of DI: What, Why, and How.”**  
You’ll explore how loose coupling makes architecture maintainable and write your first _injected_ program.
